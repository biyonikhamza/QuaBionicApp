PRO1.K1 is available in sizes from 22-29 cm and provides flex-assist at toeoff and heel. The dynamic dorsi-flexion and improved loading response reduce energy consumption and minisizes ground reaction force as such, the heel impact is automatically dampened , giving the patient a soft rollover. As a result , the patient moves more easily and safely. Chopart also actively supports the forward movement, thereby allowing a smooth , natural and dynamic walking. The product comes with carbon socks and shells that do not have to be ordered separately. Advice for technicians: After preparing the Chopart socket , the Chopart carbon foot is stuck to the socket with a prothetic adhesive. Prior to this, the static settings must be made very carefully by correctly determining the connecting points of the lamination anchor."
